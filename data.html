          <p1>The goal of this project is to calculate the population density of subway stations to easily allow people to avoid crowds. I planned to do this by reviewing several MTA subway metrics and using them to estimate the population density at subway stations. So far I have reviewed the data sets and analyzed key patterns for overlapping data. I have not yet made a visualization but I will probably use a histogram to show pouplation on certain days of the week.</p1>
